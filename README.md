# Webpack and Vite Demo

This repo originally used Webpack. A simple Vite setup has been added to run the same code.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start Webpack dev server
- `npm run dev:vite` – start Vite dev server
- `npm run build:vite` – build with Vite into `dist-vite`

The application logs the sum of two numbers in the browser console.
